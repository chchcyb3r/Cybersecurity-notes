Here is steps to configure login with Passphrase

Steps:
1. Generate SSH Key Pair:

    Open a terminal window. 

Navigate to your SSH directory: cd ~/.ssh 
Generate the key pair with a passphrase: ssh-keygen -t rsa 

    When prompted, enter a strong passphrase and re-enter it to confirm. 

2. Identify your public key:

    View your public key: cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 

3. Add the public key to the server:

    Using ssh-copy-id (recommended):
        Run: ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub username@server_address
        Enter your server password when prompted. 

Key points to remember:

    Strong passphrase: Choose a complex passphrase that is difficult to guess. 

File permissions: Make sure your .ssh directory and authorized_keys file have appropriate permissions (chmod 700 ~/.ssh and chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys) 

To verify your setup:

    Try logging into your Ubuntu server using SSH.
    You should be prompted to enter your passphrase when attempting to connect.
